This contain work on reinforcement learning using deep Q learning, using PyTorch. 
There are 3 gym tasks being solved:
1. CartPole: try to balance a pole vertyically by moving left and right
2. Lunar Lander: try to land the lunar lander on the moon between the 2 flags using the least amount of fuel.
3. Mountain Car: try to get to the flag at the top right mountain bt building up momentum 

Deep Q network is a simple feed forward network with just 2 hidden layers of 64 nodes each.
